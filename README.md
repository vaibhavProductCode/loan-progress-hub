LOAN PULSE PROJECT

Problem: Loan applicants face high drop-offs and loss of trust due to zero visibility across multi-party verification stages (banks, NBFCs, KYC, credit bureaus).

Approach: Designed an end-to-end loan journey state machine, identified highest drop-off stages, and scoped a V1 focused on orchestration, transparency, and early risk signals.

Solution: Built a proactive loan orchestration platform that surfaces application states, flags issues early, and delivers state-aware, actionable user communication.

Impact: Reduced verification-stage drop-offs by ~40% (modeled), delivered a full PRD, system flow, and self-explanatory prototype within 4 days.
